                <p>
                    My name is Spencer Fife. I am formerly a baker in trade, but now have decided to apply myself to the
                    coding and programming field. I was born in Seattle and have lived there my entire life, so far.
                    Growingup it was hard to ignore the tech and internet boom and now the field seems to still be
                    competitive and ever growing. It seems natural to get caught up in the zeitgeist of the programming
                    industry, as it is embedded in our daily lives and I want to be a part of it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is my first dabbling with coding and by the end of this coding bootcamp, I want it to represent
                    what I've learned and how I apply that knowledge. It may be rough right now, but it is miles ahead
                    of what I could do when I signed up for this class.
                </p>
