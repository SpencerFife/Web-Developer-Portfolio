                My name is Spencer Fife. I am formerly a baker in trade, but now have decided to apply myself to the
                coding and programming field. I was born in Seattle and have lived there my entire life, so far. Growing
                up it was hard to ignore the tech and internet boom and now the field seems to still be competitive and
                ever growing. It seems natural to get caught up in the zeitgeist of the programming industry, as it is
                embedded in our daily lives and I want to be a part of it.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is my first dabbling with coding and by the end of this coding bootcamp, I want it to represent
                what I've learned and how I apply that knowledge. It may be rough right now, but it is miles ahead of
                what I could do when I signed up for
                this class.
            </p>
